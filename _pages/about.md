[**MotionPersona: Toward Character-aware Locomotion Control**]()

Mingyi Shi, Wei Liu, Jidong Mei, **Wangpok Tse**, Xuelin Chen, Taku Komura

- Introduced MotionPersona, a real-time character controller that generates diverse animations with personalized motion characteristics. The controller is trained with an extensive motion capture dataset with diverse human subjects, in terms of the age, gender, weight, height and body shape.

[**Driver Alert and Facial Recognition System**](https://github.com/JerryTseee/Driver_State_Alert_System.git)

**Wangpok Tse**

- Developed an AR driver detection system using OpenCV, aiming to enhance real-time driver safety. Face, age, and gender recognition were achieved by using Haar Cascades algorithm and a pre-trained model. Designed a head-eye position index and identity recognition to identify dangerous driving behaviors.

# üíª Internships
- *2024.05 - Present*, I worked as a **research assistant** in the [**HKU Computer Graphics and Visualization Lab**](https://hku-cg.github.io/), supervised by [**Prof. Taku Komura**](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~taku/). My duty was to use machine learning and deep learning techniques to construct AR/VR and character animation, especially on digital human application. And used Vicon motion capture system to collect datasets. I also helped developing an Python automation pipeline to convert metahuman to OBJ files in Unreal Engine 5 and Maya.
- *2023.12 - 2024.02*, I worked as a **data scientist intern** in the [**SmartAge Intelligence Limited, Hong Kong**](https://smart-age.net/eng/). My job was to collect the elderly activity data and help to do the data analysis to discover potential business value in the elderly market. I was also responsible for the renovation of product website on Wordpress.
- *2023.08 - Present*, I worked as an **IT Assistant** in the [**Hong Kong Hakka Associations**](https://hkhakka.com/). I helped to organized 2023 Hakka Student Scholarship Award Event. Using Excel to input the personal information of students, and designing an event poster with Figma. (Now I am the part-time volunteer and Hakka student ambassador, help to promote Hakka culture to the world)
