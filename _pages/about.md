# üêß About Me
- ‚ú® I am TSE Wang Pok (Ë∞¢ÂÆèÂçö). I am pursuing two bachelor degrees, **BEng in computer engineering** and **BBA in finance**, at the **University of Hong Kong**. My research interests in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science**. Welcome to connect with me: s201943158@gmail.com or crazytse@connect.hku.hk üëÄ


# üìñ Educations
- *2022.09 - 2027.06*, Bachelor of Engineering in computer engineering (double degree), the University of Hong Kong
- *2022.09 - 2027.06*, Bachelor of Business Administration in finance (double degree), the University of Hong Kong
- *2019.09 - 2022.05*, Hong Kong Kowloon Tong Heungto Middle School

# üíª Internships
- *2024.05 - 2025.01*, I worked as a **research assistant** in the [**HKU Computer Graphics and Visualization Lab**](https://hku-cg.github.io/), supervised by [**Prof. Taku Komura**](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~taku/). My duty was to use machine learning and deep learning techniques to construct AR/VR and character animation, especially on digital human application. And used Vicon motion capture system to collect locomotion datasets. I also helped to write some Python scripts for Unreal Engine 5
- *2023.12 - 2024.02*, I worked as a **data scientist AI intern** in the [**SmartAge Intelligence Limited, Hong Kong**](https://smart-age.net/eng/). My job was to do the data analysis on collected data and to discover potential business value in the elderly market. I was also responsible for the renovation of product website using Wordpress.

**Driver Alert and Facial Recognition System Prototype**
- an AR-based driver safety system using OpenCV and Python, aiming to enhance real-time driver safety. Integrated Haar Cascades algorithm and a pre-trained machine learning model for face, age and gender recognition. Designed algorithms to detect dangerous driving behaviors by analyzing head-eye position parameters and facial identity
