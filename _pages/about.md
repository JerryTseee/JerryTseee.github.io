[**Driver Alert and Facial Recognition System**](https://github.com/JerryTseee/Driver_State_Alert_System.git)

**Wangpok Tse**

- Developed an AR driver detection system using OpenCV, aiming to enhance real-time driver safety. Face, age, and gender recognition were achieved by using Haar Cascades algorithm and a pre-trained model. Designed a head-eye position index and identity recognition to identify dangerous driving behaviors.
