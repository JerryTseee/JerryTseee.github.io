I am TSE Wang Pok (nickname: Jerry). Currently I am pursuing two bachelor degrees, BEng in computer engineering and BBA in finance, at the University of Hong Kong. In addition, I also have an undergraduate exchange experience at the CentraleSupelec, University of Paris-Saclay.

My research interest includes machine learning, computer vision, digital humans, and data science. I also have a strong enthusiasm for exploring various topics in the realm of computer science.
